# Linthra

A modern, **local-first**, privacy-focused music player for people who own
their music. Linthra is a clean alternative to bloated streaming apps — your
library lives on your device, and downloads are always under your explicit
control.

> **Your music, beautifully yours.**

## Status

**Early-stage, but Library v1 is wired end to end.** Alongside the project
structure, dark-first theming, navigation, app shell, core domain models, and
the service/repository *interfaces*, the Library feature now works as a real
vertical slice.

**Library v1.** The Library screen can scan a local folder, persist the
discovered tracks through `MusicLibraryRepository`, and list them back. The
flow is: `LocalMusicSource` discovers audio files under a folder →
`LibraryController` persists them via `MusicLibraryRepository.upsertCatalog`
→ `LibraryScreen` renders the stored tracks (each as title + artist/album, or
the uri/path when no tags exist). The screen renders four states — **loading,
empty, populated, and error** (with retry) — and the UI only ever talks to
`LibraryController`/`LibraryState` and the repository abstraction, never to
Drift or a `MusicSource` directly. Scanning, persistence, and UI state stay in
separate, individually testable layers. See **Android readiness & known
limitations** below for what is intentionally deferred.

`LocalMusicSource` (`lib/core/sources/local/`) discovers audio files under a
configured folder and maps them into `Track`s. It does no tag parsing yet —
it's the first concrete `MusicSource` and the seam future metadata parsing will
extend.

**Folder selection now uses the native picker.** The folder icon in the Library
app bar opens the OS folder chooser (Android Storage Access Framework / desktop
GTK) via a `FolderPickerService` seam, persists the chosen folder through a
`SelectedMusicFolderRepository`, and then scans it. The choice survives restarts
(`shared_preferences` in the app; in-memory in tests). All of this stays behind
interfaces: the UI talks only to `SelectedFolderController` and
`LibraryController`, never to `file_picker` or `shared_preferences` directly.
The scan itself is still exposed as `LibraryController.scanFolder(path)` and runs
through `LocalMusicSource`, so the flow stays fully testable without a real disk
or OS dialog (the picker, the file-system seam, and the selected-folder store are
each overridden with a fake/in-memory binding in tests). The scan seam now also
routes Android `content://` Storage Access Framework selections to a SAF-aware
scanner rather than assuming a filesystem path. See **Android folder selection &
known limitations** below for what still needs care on modern Android.

A temporary `InMemoryMusicLibraryRepository` (`lib/data/repositories/`) also
implements the `MusicLibraryRepository` contract, so the app and its tests have
a concrete catalog to read from. It keeps tracks, albums, and artists in memory,
grouped by source — it is **not persistent** and exists only for development and
testing.

**Drift/SQLite persistence** has now landed for tracks.
`DriftMusicLibraryRepository` (`lib/data/repositories/`) is the persistent
catalog the UI will read from, backed by `LinthraDatabase`
(`lib/data/database/`). At schema **v1** only the `tracks` table is persisted:
`getAllTracks`, `getTrackById`, and `upsertCatalog` are real, while
`getAllAlbums`/`getAllArtists` return empty lists for now. Domain models
(`core/models/`) stay separate from Drift rows; conversion lives in small,
explicit mappers (`lib/data/mappers/`). The generated `*.g.dart` files are
produced by the **Generate Drift files** workflow (see below), not committed by
hand. The running app now persists through the Drift repository: `main`
applies `driftMusicLibraryRepositoryOverride` over `musicLibraryRepositoryProvider`
so scanned tracks survive a restart, while tests keep the in-memory default
(no `path_provider`/SQLite needed) unless they opt into the Drift binding. The
UI is untouched by the swap — it still reads only `LibraryController`/the
repository abstraction.

**Offline downloads — foundation landed.** The offline-cache lifecycle now
works end to end behind `DownloadRepository`. `CacheDownloadRepository`
(`lib/data/repositories/`) owns the policy in one place and tracks each item's
`DownloadStatus` (`notDownloaded → queued → downloading → downloaded`, plus
`failed`). Two promises are enforced here, not scattered through the UI:
**downloads are only ever user-initiated** (nothing downloads automatically),
and the **"Wi-Fi only" preference is respected** (a request made off Wi-Fi is
*queued* rather than run). Only the `downloaded` set is durable; the transient
states live in memory, so a restart never resurrects a half-finished download.

The durable bit — *which* track IDs are cached — sits behind a small
`DownloadStore` seam, persisted via `shared_preferences` in the app and held
in memory in tests (same reasoning as the selected-folder store: a list of IDs
is the wrong weight for the SQLite catalog). The "Wi-Fi only" switch is a
`DownloadPreferences` seam, also `shared_preferences`-backed. Connectivity is
read through a `ConnectivityService` seam; until real remote downloads land,
the default `OptimisticConnectivityService` reports Wi-Fi (there is no network
fetch to gate yet), and tests inject a fake to drive the mobile/offline paths.
The UI never touches file paths: the Library row shows a per-track
download/remove control and status, and the Downloads tab lists cached tracks
and hosts the "Wi-Fi only" toggle — both talk only to the repository
abstraction. **No actual bytes are fetched yet** (the only source is local
files already on disk); the byte-fetch for remote sources slots into one
private method without the policy changing. See **Offline downloads & known
limitations** below.

Not built yet (planned, in roughly this order):

- Local music library scanning — *v1 done (scan → persist → list); native
  folder picker + persisted selection now done; Android `content://` tree URIs
  are now routed and resolved for external storage; tag parsing,
  content-resolver SAF scanning, and a narrow Android media permission still
  pending*
- Audio playback — *done (local playback + up-next queue); background playback
  + media session foundation via `audio_service` now wired (Android Auto
  readiness, not yet a full car UI)*
- Playlists
- User-controlled offline downloads — *foundation done (status lifecycle,
  mark/remove offline, Wi-Fi-only seam, UI hooks); real remote byte-fetch and a
  background download manager still pending*
- Lyrics

Self-hosted sources (Jellyfin, WebDAV, NAS) come after the local MVP is solid.

## Philosophy

- **Local-first & offline-first** — the UI always reads from a local cache.
- **Privacy-focused** — no telemetry, no forced sync.
- **User-controlled downloads** — never automatic; "Wi-Fi only" is respected.
- **No vendor lock-in** — sources (local, Jellyfin, WebDAV, NAS) sit behind a
  single interface.
- **Contributor-friendly** — small focused files, explicit naming, clean layers.

## Target platforms

Android first, Linux desktop later, and possibly Windows — all from one Flutter
codebase.

## Tech stack

| Concern          | Choice                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Framework        | Flutter                                           |
| State management | Riverpod                                          |
| Navigation       | go_router (`StatefulShellRoute` for bottom nav)   |
| Local metadata   | SQLite via `drift`                                |
| Playback         | `just_audio` + `audio_service` (behind interface) |

Dependencies are added when a feature needs them rather than up front, so
`pubspec.yaml` stays honest about what the code actually uses. Today that's
`flutter_riverpod`, `go_router`, `path` (for the local file scanner),
`drift` + `sqlite3_flutter_libs` + `path_provider` for SQLite persistence,
`just_audio` for playback, `audio_service` for the background media session
(notification / lock screen / Android Auto), `file_picker` for the native
folder chooser, and `shared_preferences` for remembering the selected folder
(`drift_dev` + `build_runner` are dev-only, for code generation).

## Architecture

Layered and feature-first. The golden rule: **features depend on interfaces in
`core/`, never on concrete services or storage.** That seam is what makes the
Jellyfin/WebDAV roadmap possible without rewriting the UI.

### Key extension points

- **`MusicSource`** (`core/services/music_source.dart`) — a media backend.
  `LocalMusicSource` ships first; `JellyfinMusicSource` / `WebDavMusicSource`
  implement the same contract later.
- **`MusicLibraryRepository`** (`core/repositories/`) — the local SQLite cache
  the UI reads from. Sources *sync into* it; the UI never talks to a source
  directly. This is what keeps the app fast and fully offline.
- **`PlaybackController`** (`core/services/playback_controller.dart`) — playback
  *and* the up-next queue, fully decoupled from `just_audio`. It owns a pure
  [`PlaybackQueue`](lib/core/models/playback_queue.dart) model (current track +
  upcoming tracks) and exposes `playTracks`, `playNext`, `skipToNext`, and
  `clearQueue`; the UI reads the queue from `PlaybackState` and never edits it
  directly. `LinthraAudioHandler` wraps it for background audio / the platform
  media session (notification, lock screen, Android Auto) without touching
  feature code; MPRIS can attach the same way later.
- **`DownloadRepository`** (`core/repositories/`) — enforces the
  user-initiated, "Wi-Fi only"-respecting download policy in one place.
  `CacheDownloadRepository` implements it today over a `DownloadStore`
  (durable cached-ID set), a `DownloadPreferences` ("Wi-Fi only" switch), and a
  `ConnectivityService`. Remote (Jellyfin/WebDAV) downloads add a real
  byte-fetch in `_obtainOfflineCopy` without touching the policy or the UI.

## Getting started

This repository contains the Dart/Flutter source plus the committed **Android**
platform scaffold (`android/`). Other native platform folders (`linux/`, …)
are **not committed** — generate them locally when you need them so the repo
stays focused on the cross-platform Dart code.

```bash
# 1. Fetch dependencies
flutter pub get

# 2. Run on a connected Android device or emulator
flutter run

# (Optional) generate scaffolding for another platform, e.g. Linux desktop:
flutter create --platforms=linux .
```

> Note: `flutter create` may regenerate template files such as `main.dart`.
> If prompted, keep the existing versions in this repo.

### Building a debug APK (Android)

The `android/` scaffold is committed, so no `flutter create` step is needed.
You do need a working Android SDK (`ANDROID_HOME`/`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` set) and a
JDK that matches the bundled Gradle wrapper — **JDK 17** is the safe choice
for the Gradle 8.3 / Android Gradle Plugin 8.1 the scaffold ships with. Run
`flutter doctor` to confirm your toolchain.

To install and test Linthra on an Android phone:

```bash
flutter pub get

# Build an unsigned debug APK
flutter build apk --debug
# → build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk

# Or build and install straight onto a connected device
flutter run --debug          # hot-reloadable dev session
flutter install              # installs the last debug build
```

The debug APK is unsigned and meant for local testing only. **Release signing,
store-ready bundles, and APK publishing are intentionally out of scope** for
this stage — there are no native build, signing, or publishing steps in CI.

#### Downloading a debug APK from CI

If you don't have a local Flutter/Android toolchain, the
**Android Debug APK** workflow (`.github/workflows/android-debug-apk.yml`)
builds the same `flutter build apk --debug` output on GitHub and attaches it as
a downloadable artifact.

- **How to run it:** open the repo's **Actions** tab → **Android Debug APK** →
  **Run workflow** (the `workflow_dispatch` trigger). It also runs
  automatically on pull requests.
- **Artifact:** `linthra-debug-apk`, containing
  `app-debug.apk` (built from `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`).
- **Download:** open the completed workflow run and grab `linthra-debug-apk`
  from the run's **Artifacts** section. GitHub serves it as a `.zip`; unzip it
  to get `app-debug.apk`.
- **Install manually:** copy the APK to an Android device and open it (you may
  need to allow "install from unknown sources"), or with the device connected
  over ADB run:

  ```bash
  adb install -r app-debug.apk
  ```

This artifact is an **unsigned debug build for testing only** — it is not
signed for release, not published to any store or F-Droid, and no GitHub
release is created.

**Android identity & permissions.** The app ships with a stable application ID
**`io.github.thezupzup.linthra`** (also the Kotlin/Gradle `namespace`) and the
display name **Linthra** — both chosen for future F-Droid / GitHub Releases
distribution. Permissions are kept deliberately minimal: the production
manifest declares **no** permissions, and `INTERNET` is added only in the
`debug`/`profile` manifests (Flutter needs it for hot reload). No storage
permissions are requested — see *Android folder selection & known limitations*
for why a narrow `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` flow is a deliberate later step rather than
a broad "all files" grant.

> The `audio_service` native wiring (foreground-service permissions, the
> playback `<service>`/`<receiver>`, and `MainActivity` extending
> `AudioServiceActivity`) documented under *Background playback & Android Auto*
> is **not yet applied** to the committed scaffold. `connectMediaSession` falls
> back gracefully when it is absent, so the debug build still runs and basic
> playback works; wiring the media session is the recommended next PR.

### Building release artifacts (Android)

The **Android Release Build** workflow
(`.github/workflows/android-release-build.yml`) builds the Android **release**
artifacts so we can validate a release build ahead of any GitHub Releases /
F-Droid distribution. It is a build-only foundation:

- **How to run it:** open the repo's **Actions** tab → **Android Release
  Build** → **Run workflow**. It is **manual only** (`workflow_dispatch`) — it
  never runs on a push or PR.
- **What it builds:** `flutter build apk --release` and
  `flutter build appbundle --release`.
- **Artifacts:**
  - `linthra-release-apk` → `app-release.apk`
    (`build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`)
  - `linthra-release-aab` → `app-release.aab`
    (`build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`)
- **Download:** open the completed run and grab the artifacts from the run's
  **Artifacts** section (GitHub serves each as a `.zip`; unzip to get the
  APK/AAB).

Build the same artifacts locally with:

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release        # → build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
flutter build appbundle --release  # → build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

#### Signing status (important)

**These release artifacts are debug-key signed, not release signed.** No
release signing secrets are configured in this repository, so the release build
falls back to the debug signing config declared in `android/app/build.gradle`
(`signingConfig = signingConfigs.debug`). That makes the artifacts useful for
previewing/smoke-testing a release build, but they are **not** suitable for
store or F-Droid distribution, and **no signing keys are committed** to the
repo.

Real release signing (a keystore supplied via repository secrets, with the
`android/app/build.gradle` release `signingConfig` reading those secrets) is
**intentionally out of scope** for this foundation and is the recommended next
step — see below.

#### Limitations & next steps

- The workflow **does not** create a GitHub release, upload anything to a store,
  or submit to F-Droid. It only produces downloadable build artifacts.
- It does **not** add release signing; artifacts remain debug-key signed until a
  signing config backed by secrets is added.
- **Recommended next PR:** add release signing — provision a release keystore,
  store it and its credentials as repository secrets, decode it during the
  workflow, and update the release `signingConfig` in
  `android/app/build.gradle` to use it. With real signing in place, a separate
  follow-up can wire **GitHub Releases** publishing and, later, F-Droid
  readiness.

### Background playback & Android Auto

Linthra registers a platform **media session** through `audio_service` so
playback survives backgrounding and shows up where the OS expects it:

- **Notification & lock screen.** A media notification mirrors the current
  track (title / artist / album) and exposes **play/pause**, **stop**, and
  **skip-next** (the skip control only appears when the up-next queue has a
  track). Position updates flow through so scrubbing/seek work from the system
  UI.
- **Android Auto readiness.** The same session is what Android Auto and other
  media browsers attach to, so the now-playing card and transport controls are
  reachable from the car head unit. This PR lays the **foundation** — it does
  *not* yet ship a browsable media library (folders/albums/playlists in the car
  UI). That polish is a later PR.

**Architecture.** `audio_service` is a pure infrastructure layer.
`LinthraAudioHandler` (`lib/core/services/linthra_audio_handler.dart`) is the
only file that imports it: it forwards session commands
(play/pause/stop/skip/seek) to the `PlaybackController` and mirrors the
controller's `PlaybackState` back out as the session's playback state + media
item. The controller (still `just_audio`-backed) stays the single source of
truth, and **the UI continues to depend only on `PlaybackController`** — never
on `audio_service`. Attaching the session in `main.dart` is best-effort: if it
fails to initialise (e.g. an unsupported platform) basic playback still works.

**Required native setup** (the `android/` folder is generated locally, see
above). For the media session to run as a foreground service and be visible to
Android Auto, add to `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<manifest ...>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
  <uses-permission
      android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK" />

  <application ...>
    <!-- audio_service playback service -->
    <service
        android:name="com.ryanheise.audioservice.AudioService"
        android:foregroundServiceType="mediaPlayback"
        android:exported="true">
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.media.browse.MediaBrowserService" />
      </intent-filter>
    </service>

    <!-- Media button + Android Auto receiver -->
    <receiver
        android:name="com.ryanheise.audioservice.MediaButtonReceiver"
        android:exported="true">
      <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MEDIA_BUTTON" />
      </intent-filter>
    </receiver>
  </application>
</manifest>
```

The main activity should extend `AudioServiceActivity` (per the `audio_service`
README) so the session binds correctly. The notification channel id/name are
configured in `connectMediaSession` (`com.linthra.audio` / "Linthra playback").

**Limitations (this PR).**

- No browsable car/media-browser tree yet (no folder/album/playlist nodes in
  Android Auto) — only the now-playing session.
- No previous-track / skip-to-previous control (the queue model is forward-only
  for now).
- No advanced queue editing from the session.
- No MPRIS (Linux desktop media keys) yet.
- Lock-screen artwork depends on `Track.artworkUri`, which local scanning does
  not populate yet.

### Android folder selection & known limitations

**How scanning works now.** Tap the folder icon in the Library app bar → the
native folder chooser opens → the chosen folder is persisted and immediately
scanned. The selection survives restarts, and the empty state adapts: when no
folder is chosen it invites you to pick one; when a folder is chosen but nothing
playable is found it shows that folder and offers **Rescan folder** / **Change
folder**. On Linux/desktop the same flow uses the GTK/Win32 directory dialog and
returns a real filesystem path, which `LocalMusicSource` scans directly.

**How content:// folders are scanned.** On modern Android the folder chooser
hands back a `content://…/tree/…` URI under the Storage Access Framework rather
than a filesystem path. Scanning now routes each selection through a single seam
(`PlatformAudioFileScanner`):

- **Filesystem paths** (desktop/Linux, and any path Android hands back) go to
  `IoAudioFileScanner` — the existing `dart:io` walk, unchanged.
- **`content://` tree URIs** go to `ContentUriAudioFileScanner`, which uses
  `SafTreeUriResolver` to map an external-storage tree URI to a real path
  (`primary:Music` → `/storage/emulated/0/Music`, named SD-card volumes →
  `/storage/<volume>/…`, and `raw:` ids that already carry an absolute path),
  then walks that path. Folders selected this way are stored as ordinary file
  paths, so playback resolution is unchanged.

How a selection is addressed (path vs `content://`) is decided once by
`FolderLocation`; nothing downstream re-parses the string, and the UI never
sees any of it.

Deliberate gaps the next PRs will close:

- **Scoped storage / content-resolver scanning.** `SafTreeUriResolver` covers
  the common `com.android.externalstorage.documents` provider. Other SAF
  providers (downloads, media, cloud/document providers) don't expose a stable
  path, so a selection from one of those surfaces a clear `FolderScanException`
  in the Library error state instead of a silent empty list. The full
  follow-up is reading a SAF tree through Android's content resolver (via a
  native plugin), which also covers devices where scoped storage hides a
  resolved path behind the framework. The routing and error seams are in place
  for it.
- **No runtime storage permissions yet.** No `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` request flow is
  wired up, and **`MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` is intentionally *not* requested** —
  it is an "all files access" permission Google restricts on the Play Store and
  it is the opposite of the scoped-storage approach this project prefers. On
  Android 11+ a resolved path can still be unreadable without a media
  permission; granting `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` (a narrow, audio-only permission) is
  the natural next step. Until then, point the scan at a folder the app can
  already read, or use the content-resolver follow-up above.
- **No tag/metadata parsing.** Tracks show their title (derived from the file
  name) and fall back to the file path when artist/album tags are absent.
- **Basic up-next queue, no playlists.** Tapping a track in the Library plays it
  and queues the rest of the visible list behind it; the Now Playing screen shows
  the current track, an **Up next** list, a **Next** button, and **Clear** (which
  empties up next but keeps the current track). When a track finishes, playback
  rolls into the next queued track. Reordering, saved playlists, shuffle, and
  repeat are not part of this foundation yet.
- **No downloads or remote sources** (Jellyfin/WebDAV) yet.

### Testing scanning on Android

1. Build and install a debug APK (see *Building a debug APK* above) on a device
   or emulator.
2. Put a few audio files under a folder on shared storage, e.g.
   `/storage/emulated/0/Music`.
3. In **Library**, tap the folder icon and pick that folder. The chooser
   returns a `content://…/tree/primary:Music` URI; Linthra resolves it to the
   path and scans it.
4. Picking a folder from a provider that has no filesystem mapping (for example
   a cloud "Documents" provider) is expected to show the Library error state
   with a clear message — that's the documented limitation, not a crash.

The next PR is expected to be a playlist-editor foundation or Android SAF
content-resolver folder scanning; a narrow `READ_MEDIA_AUDIO` permission flow
remains a natural follow-up to this work.

### Offline downloads & known limitations

**How it works now.** Each Library row shows an offline-download control:
download an absent track, see a spinner while it's in flight, and remove a
cached one. The Downloads tab lists everything currently cached and hosts the
**Wi-Fi only** toggle. All of this flows through `DownloadRepository`, which
centralizes two guarantees:

- **User-initiated only.** A track's status only ever changes in response to an
  explicit download/remove action — nothing is fetched automatically or in the
  background.
- **Wi-Fi only is respected.** With the toggle on, a request made off Wi-Fi is
  *queued* instead of run; with it off, downloads proceed on any connection.

`downloaded` is the only durable state (persisted as a set of track IDs via
`shared_preferences`); `queued`/`downloading`/`failed` are in-memory and reset
on restart.

Deliberate gaps the next PRs will close:

- **No real downloads yet.** The only source is local files already on disk, so
  "downloading" just records the track as offline-available. Fetching bytes from
  a remote source (Jellyfin/WebDAV) is the follow-up; it slots into
  `CacheDownloadRepository._obtainOfflineCopy` without changing the policy.
- **No background download manager.** Downloads run inline in response to the
  tap; there is no worker, no Android download/notification service, and no
  auto-flush of the queue when Wi-Fi returns (re-tap a queued track to retry).
- **Connectivity is optimistic.** `OptimisticConnectivityService` always reports
  Wi-Fi until `connectivity_plus` is wired alongside real remote downloads, so
  the "Wi-Fi only" gate has nothing to block in the current local-only build —
  the seam and its tests are in place for when it does.
- **No Drift table for downloads.** Persisting a flat ID set is a key/value job;
  a `downloads` table (with file paths and byte progress) graduates from the
  `DownloadStore` seam when real downloads need it.

## Continuous integration

Every pull request and every push to `main` runs a small Flutter workflow
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). It needs to be green before a change merges.

CI runs the checks below, and you can run the exact same ones locally before
opening a PR:

```bash
flutter pub get                      # resolve dependencies
dart format --set-exit-if-changed .  # code must already match `dart format`
flutter analyze                      # static analysis + lints
flutter test                         # widget/unit tests
```

CI pins **Flutter 3.27.x (stable)** for reproducible results; using a matching
SDK locally avoids spurious `dart format` diffs from formatter changes in newer
Dart releases. This is code-quality CI only — there are no native build,
signing, or store-publishing steps yet.

### Generating Drift files in CI

Drift/SQLite persistence relies on `build_runner` code generation, which can be
unreliable to run locally. The **Generate Drift files** workflow
(`.github/workflows/generate-drift.yml`) runs that generation in CI and commits
the result back to the chosen branch. It is **manual only** (`workflow_dispatch`)
— it never runs on a normal push or PR, and it neither builds nor publishes
anything. It uses the same Flutter version as the main CI workflow, runs
`flutter pub get`, `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`,
and `dart format .`, then commits **only if** something actually changed.

To regenerate Drift files on a PR:

1. Open the Drift PR.
2. Go to the **Actions** tab.
3. Select the **Generate Drift files** workflow.
4. Click **Run workflow** and choose the PR branch.
5. Wait for the bot to push the generated commit (`Generate Drift files`).
6. Let normal CI run against the updated branch.

The workflow pushes to whichever branch you launch it on, so run it on the PR
branch rather than `main`.

## Roadmap (MVP)

1. Local music library scanning
2. Artist / album / track views
3. Playlist creation & editing
4. Audio playback
5. Queue management
6. Search
7. Album artwork
8. Explicit offline downloads
9. "Wi-Fi only downloads" option
10. Settings

Later: Jellyfin, WebDAV, NAS, lyrics, ReplayGain, MPRIS, Android Auto, smart
playlists, and more.

## F-Droid metadata (work in progress)

Linthra is **not** on F-Droid yet, and no submission has been made. As
groundwork for a possible future submission, the repository now carries
F-Droid / Fastlane-style store metadata under
`fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/`:

- `title.txt` — app name.
- `short_description.txt` — one-line summary (kept under F-Droid's 80-char
  limit).
- `full_description.txt` — long description that deliberately separates what
  works today from what is still planned.
- `changelogs/1.txt` — placeholder release notes for `versionCode` 1 (the
  current `0.1.0+1`); replaced with real notes once a published version exists.

**Known missing assets.** No real screenshots, feature graphic, or store icon
have been captured from a running build, so none are committed. `images/` only
contains `NEEDED-ASSETS.txt`, which documents the expected F-Droid image layout
to fill in later. Placeholder/mock images are intentionally avoided so the
listing never misrepresents the app.

The wording describes only shipped behaviour (folder selection, scanning, and
persisted listing) as done; playback, playlists, and offline downloads are
described as planned. There are no claims of F-Droid availability and no
marketing language that overpromises.
