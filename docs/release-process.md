# Release process (versioning, tagging & GitHub Releases)

This is the canonical reference for how Linthra cuts a release: versioning,
git tagging, changelogs, and the (manual) GitHub-Release flow. The F-Droid
docs reference this document rather than restating the plan.

> **No release has been cut and nothing here publishes to a store.** Linthra
> has no tagged release yet, is **not** on F-Droid, and no APK/AAB has been
> published. Pushing a `v*` tag now builds the release artifacts automatically.
> For **alpha/beta/rc** tags the build can create a GitHub **pre-release** and
> attach the APK/AAB to it; for **stable** tags it only attaches to a Release you
> created. **Writing the release notes stays manual** — and nothing is published
> to any store or to F-Droid. This document describes the intended process.

## 1. Versioning model

`pubspec.yaml` is the **single source of truth** for the version:

```
version: x.y.z+<versionCode>      # currently 0.1.0-alpha.1+1
```

- **`versionName` = `x.y.z`** — the human-facing [SemVer](https://semver.org/)
  string.
- **`versionCode` = the integer after `+`** — Android's internal build number.

Android reads both from Flutter (`flutter.versionName` / `flutter.versionCode`
in `android/app/build.gradle`); they are **not** hard-coded in Gradle, so
bumping `pubspec.yaml` is enough.

**Rules:**

- `versionCode` **must increase monotonically** on every release. Never reuse or
  decrease it — Android refuses to install an update with an equal/lower code,
  and F-Droid relies on it to order versions.
- `versionName` follows SemVer. Pre-1.0, treat `0.y.z` as "still early; the API
  and feature set can change between minor versions." A SemVer pre-release
  suffix (e.g. `0.1.0-alpha.1`) marks an explicitly unstable build; the matching
  tag is `vX.Y.Z-suffix` and the GitHub Release should be marked **pre-release**.

## 2. Tagging

F-Droid (and our own release tracking) builds from a **git tag**.

- **Format:** an **annotated** tag `vX.Y.Z` (e.g. `v0.1.0`) on the exact commit
  to be released:

  ```sh
  git tag -a v0.1.0 -m "Linthra 0.1.0"
  git push origin v0.1.0
  ```

- The tag's `vX.Y.Z` must match `pubspec.yaml`'s `versionName`. This keeps the
  F-Droid `UpdateCheckMode: Tags ^v[0-9.]+$` / `AutoUpdateMode: Version v%v`
  recommendation (see [fdroid-build-recipe.md §2](./fdroid-build-recipe.md#2-expected-f-droid-metadata-repo-fields))
  working without false positives.
- Tag only commits where CI is green **and** generated files are current (§3).

## 3. Pre-tag checklist

Before creating a release tag:

1. **Bump the version** in `pubspec.yaml` (`versionName` and `versionCode`).
2. **Add a changelog** for the new `versionCode` at
   `fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/changelogs/<versionCode>.txt` (e.g.
   `1.txt` for `0.1.0-alpha.1+1`). Keep it short and factual; this is what
   F-Droid shows. A longer GitHub-Release body can live under
   `docs/release-notes/vX.Y.Z*.md` (see the
   [v0.1.0-alpha.1 draft](./release-notes/v0.1.0-alpha.1.md)).
3. **Regenerate committed generated files** (Drift `*.g.dart`) so they match the
   schema at the tagged commit — run the
   [Generate Drift files workflow](../README.md#generating-drift-files-in-ci) or
   `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` locally, and commit
   the result. The committed output means the F-Droid build needs no `build_runner`
   prebuild (see [fdroid-build-recipe.md §4](./fdroid-build-recipe.md#4-reproducibility-notes)).
4. **CI is green** (`flutter analyze`, `flutter test`, formatting) on the commit.
5. **Confirm licensing** is still accurate if dependencies changed — re-run the
   [dependency & license audit](./dependency-license-audit.md).
6. Create the annotated tag (§2).

## 4. GitHub Releases (notes manual, artifact build & attachment automatic)

Pushing a `v*` tag starts the build. The **Android Release Build** workflow
(`.github/workflows/android-release-build.yml`) runs automatically on a `v*`
tag, builds the APK/AAB, and attaches them to a GitHub Release. **Writing the
release notes stays manual** — the workflow never authors production notes,
publishes to a store, or submits to F-Droid. It listens only to the tag `push`
(not to `release: published`), so a tag builds exactly once. See
[docs/release-signing.md](./release-signing.md) for the signing details.

The attachment behavior depends on whether the tag is a **pre-release**:

- **Alpha/beta/rc tags** (any tag containing `alpha`, `beta`, or `rc`, e.g.
  `v0.1.0-alpha.1`) may attach **debug-signed** *or* **release-signed**
  artifacts to a GitHub **pre-release**. If no Release exists for the tag yet,
  the workflow **creates one as a pre-release** with placeholder notes (edit
  them afterwards). Debug-signed artifacts are clearly named and labeled as
  **testing-only** builds — never as a production release.
- **Stable tags** (e.g. `v1.0.0`) **require release signing**. If the
  `LINTHRA_*` secrets are missing, the tag build **fails fast** rather than
  shipping a debug-signed build. Stable assets are only uploaded to a Release
  that **already exists**; the workflow does not auto-create stable Releases.

Artifacts are named with the version and signing label, e.g.
`linthra-v0.1.0-alpha.1-debug-signed.apk` or
`linthra-v0.1.0-alpha.1-release-signed.aab`.

### Recommended flow for an alpha/beta/rc pre-release (fully automatic)

1. Ensure generated files are current (§3) and `pubspec.yaml` matches the tag.
2. (Optional but recommended) configure the `LINTHRA_*` keystore secrets (see
   [release-signing.md §2](./release-signing.md#2-required-github-secrets-ci))
   so the attached artifacts are release-signed. Without them, the pre-release
   gets clearly-labeled **debug-signed** artifacts for testing only.
3. Push the annotated tag (§2), e.g. `v0.1.0-alpha.1`. The build runs, and a
   GitHub **pre-release** is created (if absent) with the APK/AAB attached.
4. Edit the auto-created pre-release notes (the Fastlane changelog from §3 is a
   good basis). Done.

### Recommended flow for a stable release (notes written first)

1. Ensure generated files are current (§3) and `pubspec.yaml` matches the tag.
2. Configure the `LINTHRA_*` keystore secrets — **required** for stable tags
   (the tag build fails without them).
3. In the GitHub UI, **create the Release** against a **new** stable tag
   `vX.Y.Z`, write the notes. Creating the Release on a new tag also creates and
   pushes that tag.
4. That tag push triggers **Android Release Build** automatically. When it
   finishes, the **release-signed** APK/AAB are attached to the Release. Done.

### Alternative flow (tag from git first)

1. Push the annotated tag from git (§2). For a stable tag with no Release yet,
   the **release-signed** artifacts are produced as workflow artifacts but
   nothing is attached.
2. Create the GitHub Release for the tag and write its notes, then either
   **re-run** the workflow for that tag (it will now find the Release and
   attach) or download the artifacts from the original run and attach them
   manually.

> A `signed = false` manual run, or any build without the signing secrets,
> produces **debug-signed** artifacts. Those are previews/testing builds only.
> They may be attached to an alpha/beta/rc **pre-release** (clearly labeled), but
> **must never** be attached to a stable Release.

Manual `workflow_dispatch` runs remain available for ad-hoc test builds; they
never touch any GitHub Release.

> **Signature note.** A GitHub-Release APK is signed with **our** release key,
> while an F-Droid build of the same version is signed with **F-Droid's** key.
> The two cannot be cross-installed as updates of each other. This is expected;
> call it out in the release notes so users don't mix sources. See
> [release-signing.md §6](./release-signing.md#6-f-droid-signing-considerations).

## 5. F-Droid relationship

F-Droid does **not** consume our signed artifacts. When/if Linthra is submitted:

- F-Droid builds **from source** at the `vX.Y.Z` tag on its own infrastructure
  and signs with **F-Droid's** key.
- The recipe tracks new releases via the `vX.Y.Z` tags this process creates.
- The full submission flow, metadata fields, and draft recipe live in
  [docs/fdroid-build-recipe.md](./fdroid-build-recipe.md); overall status and
  blockers live in [docs/fdroid-readiness.md](./fdroid-readiness.md).

## 6. What is automated vs. manual

| Action | Automated? |
| ------ | ---------- |
| Quality CI (analyze/test/format) on PRs & `main` | **Automatic** (`ci.yml`). |
| Debug APK build | Manual (`workflow_dispatch`) + on PRs (`android-debug-apk.yml`). |
| Release APK/AAB build | **Manual** (`workflow_dispatch`) **and automatic on `v*` tags** (`android-release-build.yml`). |
| Attaching APK/AAB to a Release | **Automatic** on a `v*` tag build. Alpha/beta/rc tags attach (debug- or release-signed) to a **pre-release**; stable tags attach **release-signed** assets to an existing Release only. |
| Creating a GitHub **pre-release** (alpha/beta/rc) | **Automatic** on the tag build if no Release exists yet (placeholder notes; edit afterwards). |
| Creating a stable GitHub Release | **Manual** (operator, §4); never auto-created. |
| Drift code generation | **Manual only** (`generate-drift.yml`, `workflow_dispatch`). |
| Creating a git tag | **Manual** (operator runs `git tag`, or creates a Release on a new tag). |
| Writing production release notes | **Manual** (operator, §4). |
| Publishing to a store / F-Droid | **Not done by this repo.** |

CI builds release artifacts on a tag and attaches them: it can auto-create a
**pre-release** for alpha/beta/rc tags, but it never auto-creates a stable
Release, writes production notes, signs a store build, or submits to F-Droid.

## 7. Remaining blockers before a first release

1. **Real release signing secrets** are configured (`LINTHRA_*`) if a
   GitHub-Release artifact is wanted — see
   [release-signing.md](./release-signing.md). (Not needed for F-Droid itself,
   which signs its own builds.)
2. **A `vX.Y.Z` tag** exists — none does yet.
3. **Decide the `pubspec.lock` policy** for reproducible release builds
   ([fdroid-build-recipe.md §4](./fdroid-build-recipe.md#4-reproducibility-notes)).
4. **Feature-maturity call — made for the alpha.** `0.1.0-alpha.1` ships local
   scanning + playback, background playback / media notification, an Android
   Auto browse foundation, Jellyfin connect/sync/stream, and explicit offline
   downloads. It is published as a sideloadable, pre-release alpha (no F-Droid
   submission yet). See
   [docs/release-notes/v0.1.0-alpha.1.md](./release-notes/v0.1.0-alpha.1.md).

See [fdroid-readiness.md §8](./fdroid-readiness.md#8-remaining-blockers-before-submission)
