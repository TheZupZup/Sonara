# Development

Linthra is a standard Flutter app. The **Android** platform scaffold (`android/`)
is committed, so no `flutter create` step is needed. Other native platform
folders (`linux/`, …) are generated locally when you need them, so the repo stays
focused on the cross-platform Dart code.

## Required Flutter version

This project is pinned to **Flutter 3.27.4 (stable)**. The version lives in one
obvious place — the [`.flutter-version`](../.flutter-version) file at the repo
root — and the CI workflows pin the same value. Keep them in sync to avoid
spurious `dart format` diffs from formatter changes in newer Dart releases.

## Quick setup

In most environments (including fresh remote agent sessions where Flutter is
missing) you only need two commands:

```bash
./scripts/setup_flutter.sh    # install the pinned Flutter (no sudo, cached locally)
./scripts/verify_android.sh   # run the same checks CI runs
```

`scripts/doctor.sh` prints a quick read-only report of what's pinned, which
Flutter would be used, and whether an Android SDK is present.

### What `setup_flutter.sh` does

- Reads the pinned version from `.flutter-version`.
- **Reuses an existing matching Flutter** — if a project-local SDK or a Flutter
  already on your `PATH` matches the pinned version, nothing is downloaded.
- Otherwise downloads the pinned Flutter into the git-ignored **`.tool/flutter`**
  directory (no `sudo`, no Android SDK required, safe to re-run).
- Prints the `PATH` export to use the local SDK directly:
  `export PATH="<repo>/.tool/flutter/bin:$PATH"`.

The verification script auto-detects `.tool/flutter`, so you don't have to
update `PATH` just to run it.

### What `verify_android.sh` does

Runs, in CI order, and exits non-zero if any real check fails:

1. `flutter pub get`
2. `dart format --set-exit-if-changed .`
3. `flutter analyze`
4. `flutter test`
5. `flutter build apk --debug` — **only if an Android SDK is detected**

If no Android SDK is found (`ANDROID_HOME`/`ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` unset and no
`adb`/`sdkmanager` on `PATH`), the APK build is **skipped with a warning** —
verification does **not** fail just because the Android SDK is missing. The
analyze/format/test steps still run and still fail the script if they fail.

### How this helps

Contributors and future Claude/agent sessions get a consistent toolchain in two
commands instead of rediscovering the CI Flutter version, hand-downloading
Flutter, and improvising verification commands. The pinned version is the single
source of truth, so docs, scripts, and CI don't drift.

## Getting started (manual)

If you already have the right Flutter on your `PATH`, you can skip the setup
script entirely:

```bash
# 1. Fetch dependencies
flutter pub get

# 2. Run on a connected Android device or emulator
flutter run

# (Optional) generate scaffolding for another platform, e.g. Linux desktop:
flutter create --platforms=linux .
```

> `flutter create` may regenerate template files such as `main.dart`. If
> prompted, keep the existing versions in this repo.

## What is intentionally not committed

The repo holds source and the committed `android/` scaffold only — the
toolchain is installed per-environment:

- **The Flutter SDK** — downloaded into the git-ignored `.tool/flutter`.
- **The Android SDK** — provided by your machine/CI, never vendored here.
- **Dart/Flutter caches and build output** — `.dart_tool/`, `build/`, etc.

CI installs Flutter via the `subosito/flutter-action` GitHub Action rather than
these scripts, but pins the **same** `3.27.4`. The scripts exist for local and
remote-agent environments where that Action isn't running; both paths produce
the same checks. APK builds (CI's separate workflows, or the local
`flutter build apk`) require an Android SDK; `flutter analyze` and `flutter test`
do not.

## Troubleshooting

- **`Flutter not found`** — run `./scripts/setup_flutter.sh`, then either re-run
  `./scripts/verify_android.sh` (it auto-detects `.tool/flutter`) or
  `export PATH="$(pwd)/.tool/flutter/bin:$PATH"` to use `flutter`/`dart`
  directly.
- **Android SDK missing** — expected on machines without the Android SDK; the
  APK build is skipped and verification still passes if analyze/format/tests
  pass. Install the Android SDK and set `ANDROID_HOME` to enable
  `flutter build apk --debug`.
- **`dart format` mismatch** — run `dart format .` to apply the formatter, then
  commit the result. CI uses `--set-exit-if-changed`, so unformatted code fails.
  Make sure you're on the pinned Flutter — a newer Dart can reformat differently.
- **Tests fail** — re-run a single suite with `flutter test path/to/test.dart`
  to iterate; `verify_android.sh` runs the full `flutter test` and reports which
  steps failed at the end.
- **Download/extract fails in `setup_flutter.sh`** — the script needs `curl` or
  `wget` plus `tar`/`unzip` and exits with a clear error if a step fails. Check
  network access, then re-run (it's safe to run repeatedly).

## Building a debug APK (Android)

You need a working Android SDK (`ANDROID_HOME` / `ANDROID_SDK_ROOT` set) and a
JDK that matches the bundled Gradle wrapper — **JDK 17** is the safe choice for
the Gradle 8.3 / Android Gradle Plugin 8.1 the scaffold ships with. Run
`flutter doctor` to confirm your toolchain.

```bash
flutter pub get

# Build an unsigned debug APK
flutter build apk --debug
# → build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk

# Or build and install straight onto a connected device
flutter run --debug          # hot-reloadable dev session
flutter install              # installs the last debug build
```

The debug APK is unsigned and meant for local testing only.

### Downloading a debug APK from CI

If you don't have a local Flutter/Android toolchain, the **Android Debug APK**
workflow (`.github/workflows/android-debug-apk.yml`) builds the same
`flutter build apk --debug` output on GitHub and attaches it as a downloadable
artifact (`linthra-debug-apk`, containing `app-debug.apk`).

- **Run it:** repo **Actions** tab → **Android Debug APK** → **Run workflow**
  (`workflow_dispatch`). It also runs automatically on pull requests.
- **Install:** download the artifact (GitHub serves it as a `.zip`; unzip to get
  `app-debug.apk`), then copy it to a device and open it (allow "install from
  unknown sources"), or `adb install -r app-debug.apk`.

This artifact is an **unsigned debug build for testing only** — not signed for
release, not published to any store or F-Droid.

## Building release artifacts (Android)

The **Android Release Build** workflow
(`.github/workflows/android-release-build.yml`) builds the Android **release**
artifacts. It runs **manually** for test builds and **automatically on version
tags** (`v*`). It never publishes to a store or F-Droid and never writes
production release notes.

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter build apk --release        # → build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
flutter build appbundle --release  # → build/app/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```

Artifacts are named with both the version (tag) and the signing label, so a
debug-signed preview can never be mistaken for a production release
(e.g. `linthra-v0.1.0-alpha.1-debug-signed.apk`). Pre-release tags
(`alpha`/`beta`/`rc`) attach to a GitHub **pre-release** (created if absent);
stable tags **require release signing** and only attach to a Release you created
manually. Full versioning/tagging flow is in
[release-process.md](release-process.md).

### Versioning

Local `flutter build`/`flutter run` use the `pubspec.yaml` version, and so does
the in-app **Settings ▸ About** version (`AppInfo.version`). A **tagged** release
build instead derives the version from the tag and bakes it into both the
APK/AAB metadata and the in-app display, so they always match — see
[release-process.md §1](release-process.md#1-versioning-model).

Preview what a tag maps to, or reproduce a tag build locally:

```bash
# What versionName/versionCode does a tag produce?
dart run tool/version_from_tag.dart v0.1.0-alpha.16
# LINTHRA_VERSION_NAME=0.1.0-alpha.16
# LINTHRA_VERSION_CODE=100016

# Build exactly as a tag build would (version baked into metadata + in-app UI):
flutter build apk --release \
  --build-name=0.1.0-alpha.16 --build-number=100016 \
  --dart-define=LINTHRA_VERSION_NAME=0.1.0-alpha.16
```

### Signing status

Release signing is **wired up but not yet provisioned**. `android/app/build.gradle`
resolves a release signing config from environment variables (CI) or a
git-ignored `android/key.properties` (local). Only if complete signing material
is present does it sign with the release key; otherwise it falls back to the
**debug** key so `flutter run --release` still works. **No signing keys or
secrets are committed.** Required secrets, keystore generation/rotation, and how
this relates to F-Droid (which signs its own builds) are in
[release-signing.md](release-signing.md).

## Continuous integration

Every pull request and every push to `main` runs a small Flutter workflow
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Run the exact same checks locally before opening a
PR:

```bash
flutter pub get                      # resolve dependencies
dart format --set-exit-if-changed .  # code must already match `dart format`
flutter analyze                      # static analysis + lints
flutter test                         # widget/unit tests
```

CI pins **Flutter 3.27.x (stable)** for reproducible results; using a matching
SDK locally avoids spurious `dart format` diffs from formatter changes in newer
Dart releases. The automatic `ci.yml` workflow is **code-quality only**; native
builds and optional release signing live in separate workflows.

### Generating Drift files in CI

Drift/SQLite persistence relies on `build_runner` code generation, which can be
unreliable to run locally. The **Generate Drift files** workflow
(`.github/workflows/generate-drift.yml`) runs that generation in CI and commits
the result back to the chosen branch. It is **manual only**
(`workflow_dispatch`). Run it on your **PR branch** (not `main`): Actions →
**Generate Drift files** → **Run workflow** → choose the branch, then let the bot
push the generated commit before normal CI runs.

## Android identity & permissions

The app ships with a stable application ID **`io.github.thezupzup.linthra`** (also
the Kotlin/Gradle `namespace`) and the display name **Linthra**. The production
manifest declares only:

- **`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`** / **`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK`** — so
  `audio_service` can keep playing while backgrounded (Android 14+ requires the
  typed `mediaPlayback` grant).
- **`POST_NOTIFICATIONS`** — required on Android 13+ for the media notification;
  a *runtime* permission requested once on first launch.
- **`INTERNET`** — to reach a self-hosted Jellyfin / Subsonic server.

**No storage permission is requested** — folder access uses the Storage Access
Framework grant the user picks (see [architecture.md](architecture.md#android-folder-selection-saf)).

### Native media-session setup (applied)

The committed scaffold wires `audio_service` so the media session runs as a
foreground service and is visible to Android Auto: the manifest declares the
`com.ryanheise.audioservice.AudioService` playback service (with the
`MediaBrowserService` action and `mediaPlayback` foreground type), the
`MediaButtonReceiver`, and the `com.google.android.gms.car.application` Android
Auto media-app meta-data; `MainActivity` extends `AudioServiceActivity`. The
notification channel id/name are set in `connectMediaSession` (`com.linthra.audio`
/ "Linthra playback"). See [android-auto.md](android-auto.md) for the browse tree
and testing.

## Manual smoke test on a real Android phone

After installing the debug APK on a physical device (most useful on **Android
13+**, where the runtime notification permission applies), walk the
[manual QA checklist](manual-test-checklist.md). It covers the paths that only
behave correctly on real hardware: first-launch notification prompt, folder
pick & scan, local playback, background playback & lock-screen controls, Jellyfin
connect/sync/stream, friendly playback errors, offline downloads, the mobile-data
gate, Cast, and Android Auto — plus a security spot-check that no token ever
appears on screen.
