/// The app's [DownloadRepository] *and* [OfflineCacheManager]: it owns the
/// offline-cache *policy* in one place and delegates the moving parts to focused
/// seams — durable metadata to a [DownloadStore], cached bytes to an
/// [OfflineFileStore], the remote byte-fetch to a [RemoteTrackDownloader], and
/// the (pure) eviction decision to a [CacheEvictionPolicy].
///
/// Promises enforced here so a caller can't skip them:
///  - **Downloads are user-initiated.** A track's download *status* changes only
///    in response to [requestDownload] / [removeDownload] (or an explicit clear /
///    pin). Auto-*preloaded* tracks ([prefetch]) are cached ahead of play too,
///    but they never take on a user-download status: they stay invisible to the
///    downloads UI, count toward the limit, and are the first to be evicted.
///  - **Bounded parallelism.** Several downloads fetch their bytes at once (via
///    a [DownloadScheduler]) so caching feels fast, but never more than the
///    scheduler's small limit — the app never opens an unbounded number of
///    requests. The byte fetch runs in parallel; the cache *commit* (eviction +
///    write + metadata) is serialized, so the limit is honored even when several
///    downloads finish at once. A repeated request for a track already
///    downloading (or queued) is ignored, so a track is never fetched twice.
///  - **Source-aware.** A remote (Jellyfin) track has its bytes fetched and
///    written to the offline directory; an on-device track is already local, so
///    it's recorded as available offline with no fetch and no managed file.
///  - **Wi-Fi only is respected.** A *remote* request is queued (not run) when
///    the user set "Wi-Fi only" and the connection isn't Wi-Fi.
///  - **Stays under the cache limit.** Before writing a remote download, the
///    policy evicts least-recently-used, unpinned, not-currently-playing tracks
///    to make room; if it still won't fit, the download is refused with a
///    friendly [CacheStorageException] and nothing is cached.
///
/// Safety: only app-managed cache files (in the offline directory) are ever
/// deleted — by file name derived from the non-secret track id. The user's
/// local source files (an on-device track's own path) are never passed to the
/// file store, so they can't be deleted here. A managed file the OS reclaimed
/// is detected on load and its stale metadata pruned, so playback falls back to
/// streaming instead of opening a missing file.
///
/// The authenticated URL a remote fetch needs is resolved inside the
/// [RemoteTrackDownloader] at fetch time; this repository never sees, stores, or
/// logs it. Persisted metadata carries only the non-secret track id, a
/// id-derived file name, the source's URI scheme, a byte size, timestamps, and
/// the pinned flag — never a token or URL.
