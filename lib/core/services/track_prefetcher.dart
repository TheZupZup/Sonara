/// the [CacheDownloadRepository] implements it alongside the user-download
/// lifecycle so both share one limit and one eviction policy.
///
/// A pre-cache is *best-effort and never user-visible as a download*: it caches
/// a remote track's bytes (skipping local tracks, which are already on disk),
/// honours the user's "Wi-Fi only" and smart-pre-cache preferences, stays under
/// the cache limit (evicting other pre-cached entries first), and silently does
/// nothing on any failure — the track still streams normally when it's reached.

  /// current connection/preferences allow it. Never throws.
