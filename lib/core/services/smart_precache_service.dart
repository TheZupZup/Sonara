/// Smart pre-cache: warms a small number of upcoming Jellyfin tracks into the
/// offline cache as playback moves, so the next songs start instantly (and play
/// offline) instead of buffering a fresh stream at each track change — the
/// Plex/Plexamp-style "the next track is already here" feel, kept deliberately
/// modest so it never fills the phone or downloads the whole library.
///
/// It listens to the unified [PlaybackState] stream and, whenever the inputs
/// that decide *what to cache* change — the playing track, the queue's up-next,
/// shuffle, or repeat mode — asks a [TrackPrefetcher] to warm the next
/// `precacheCount` entries of the up-next list. Because the controller keeps
/// `upNext` in effective play order, this pre-caches the **queue order** in
/// normal playback and the **shuffled order** when shuffle is on, with no
/// special-casing. The stream is the *active* output's, so while casting it
/// still pre-caches the active queue (the queue is always owned locally).
///
/// What it does NOT do is just as important:
///  - **Repeat-one stays calm.** When the current track loops, the up-next
///    won't play soon, so pre-caching it would be wasted data and storage — the
///    service caches nothing extra and lets those tracks stream if reached.
///  - **It only decides what/when.** Everything that *bounds* a pre-cache lives
///    downstream in the [TrackPrefetcher]: it pre-caches only remote tracks
///    (skipping local files, already on disk), avoids duplicates, honours the
///    mobile-data policy (Wi-Fi always; mobile data only when the user allowed
///    it; never offline), stays under the cache limit (evicting pre-cached entries
///    before any user download), and never throws. A pre-cache never blocks or
///    interrupts what's playing.
///  - **One at a time.** Pre-caches run sequentially (effective concurrency 1),
///    off the playback path, so the cache limit settles between writes and the
///    app never opens an unbounded number of requests.
///
/// Smart pre-cache is automatic and *evictable*. To keep a song permanently,
/// the user pins it with "Keep offline" on the Downloads screen — those manual
/// downloads are protected and never auto-evicted (see `CacheEvictionPolicy`).
