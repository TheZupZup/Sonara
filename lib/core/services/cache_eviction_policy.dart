///    convenience, so it's sacrificed first to keep what the user chose to keep.
///  - Among entries of the same kind, least-recently-used goes first (oldest
///    [CachedTrack.lastAccessedAt]; never-played counts as oldest), tie-broken by
///    oldest [CachedTrack.cachedAt] then track id for determinism.
///  - If even evicting every eligible track wouldn't make room, nothing is
