/// `LocalMusicSource` (scans on-device files); future `JellyfinMusicSource`,
/// `WebDavMusicSource`, and NAS sources implement this same contract. Nothing
/// in the UI or storage layers should depend on a concrete source — only on
/// this interface — which is what keeps the app vendor-lock-in free.

/// local SQLite cache is the MusicRepository's responsibility, not the
/// source's, so that offline-first behavior stays centralized.
